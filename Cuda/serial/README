This directory contains an Octave implementation for solving the circles-fitting problem.

To execute the program from command line, use the following:

  octave -q -f findrings ../data/batchXX.dat

The entry point function is 'fitCircles'. It accepts 2 arguments:

1. file     :  the input file containing the points for which we
               need to find best-fit circles
2. plotData :  boolean flag to indicate whether to plot the final
               circles for visualization

Hence, the usage of this function within octave is:
  fitCircles('../batch00.dat', true)

This prints the final circles to stdout. If you have enabled
plotting, it will also show them in a plot window (if enabled).
